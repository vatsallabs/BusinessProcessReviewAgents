# Agentic BPR Generation Workflow (LangGraph + LangChain)

This project demonstrates an agentic workflow using LangGraph to generate a Business Process Review (BPR) document from:
- A client conversation transcript
- A discovery questionnaire
- A BPR template

The output is validated against a ground truth BPR for feedback and optional refinement.

- Modular agent design (Ingestor, Extractor, Synthesizer, Evaluator, Refiner)
- LangGraph-based stateful workflow with conditional refinement
- LangSmith tracing support for debugging and evaluation
- CLI interface for end-to-end execution
