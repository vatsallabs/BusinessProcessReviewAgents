3. Platform Landscape (Current State)
———————————————————————
| Function                 | Platform/Tool                                | Notes                                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Portfolio Management     | Charles River                                 | Front-office OMS                                  |
| Trade Execution          | Bloomberg EMSX, TradeWeb                      | Equities and Fixed Income                         |
| Middle Office (IBOR)     | Proprietary, in-house (legacy)                | Built ~10–12 years ago; brittle architecture      |
| Risk Analytics           | MSCI RiskMetrics, BRS (static reports), Excel | Fragmented; homegrown spreadsheets in use         |
| Client Reporting         | Tableau + Manual Aggregation                  | Heavily manual; inconsistent data lineage         |
| Data Warehouse           | Internal, partial integration with IBOR       | Inconsistent mappings, static data issues         |

———————————————————————
4. Trade Lifecycle Workflow
———————————————————————
**End-to-End Flow:**
1. PMs create or allocate trades in Charles River.
2. Traders execute via Bloomberg EMSX / TradeWeb.
3. Post-trade data (delayed) flows back for compliance checks.
4. Middle office confirms allocations, triggers custodian messages (SWIFT, file drops).
5. Manual exception handling via email/Excel.

**Known Issues:**
- Data Latency: 30-minute delays between OMS ↔ Middle Office.
- Static data mismatches between systems.
- Risk of trade breaks in FX/EMD due to timing & formatting errors.
- No exception management tool; "Shadow OMS" Excel governs many flows.

———————————————————————
5. Risk Management & Reporting
———————————————————————
- Fixed Income: Weekly VaR, stress testing, robust modeling.
- Equities: Ad-hoc, inconsistent risk frameworks.
- SMAs: Pricing gaps; approximations common.
- Reporting: Form PF, 13F, AIFMD – stitched manually from 5+ systems.
- Tools: Tableau for visualization, no audit trail or lineage tracking.

———————————————————————
6. Operational Bottlenecks & Manual Dependencies
———————————————————————
- Reporting requires extensive Excel cleanup and Tableau formatting.
- Risk data varies across teams—no centralized truth source.
- Client reporting complexity due to ESG, attribution, and source system mismatches.
- Trade breaks and reconciliations handled via email chains.

**Manual Tools in Use:**
- Excel VBA macros (e.g., “Shadow OMS”)
- Email folders for exception handling
- Static CSV drops, FTP file exchanges

———————————————————————
7. Integration Constraints
———————————————————————
| Integration Area         | Current State                                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| OMS ↔ Middle Office       | CSV drop (30-min lag)                         |
| Custodian ↔ Ops           | SFTP/manual file drops                        |
| Risk ↔ Front Office       | No direct API or streaming connection         |
| Reporting Systems         | Manual upload/Excel/Tableau                   |

- No event-driven architecture
- No real-time APIs
- MuleSoft/Cloud-native integration considered, not funded

———————————————————————
8. Strategic Initiatives – In Flight
———————————————————————
**"Next Gen Operating Stack" RFP**
- Evaluating: Aladdin, SimCorp, Clearwater, modular toolkits
- Drivers:
  - Consolidation vs Flexibility (CIO vs COO tension)
  - Desire for unified view across risk, trade, compliance, and reporting

———————————————————————
9. Future-State Vision
———————————————————————
- Real-time dashboards for exposures, trade status, and compliance.
- Integrated pre- and post-trade checks.
- Automated regulatory and client reporting with full traceability.
- Elimination of macros and Excel-based core processes.
- Event-driven integration and cloud-native architecture.

———————————————————————
10. Recommendations
———————————————————————
- Prioritize integration layer buildout (start with OMS ↔ Risk, OMS ↔ Custodian).
- Replace legacy IBOR with modern, vendor-supported platform.
- Implement exception management dashboard (workflow + analytics).
- Standardize risk models across asset classes.
- Enhance auditability with lineage tracking for reports.
- Reduce Excel reliance; decommission “Shadow OMS” gradually.
